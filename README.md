# MVP

This branch demonstrates creating a Dictionary Application named 'Lexicon' using Kotlin in which the user can perform the following operations:
1. Add Word
2. Modify Word
3. Remove Word

The code in this branch shows the implementation based on MVP architecture design pattern.
I am using TDD approach to develop this application.

Instead of using SQLite DB to store and retrieve words, I'll be using Google Firebase DB here. 

The following components have been used:
1. Material Design Library
2. Lottie
3. jUnit5
4. MockK
5. Firebase
6. Recycler View
