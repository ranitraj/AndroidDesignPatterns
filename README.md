# AndroidDesignPatterns  

This repository demonstrates creating a Dictionary Application named 'Lexicon' using Kotlin in which the user can perform the following operations:
1. Add Word
2. Modify Word
3. Remove Word

The same project will be demonstrated using different Architecture design patterns such as MVC, MVP and MVVM.

This will give interested readers a clear cut idea on how to create the same application using different Architecture design patterns.

The 'main' branch is just an empty project.

Checkout to the following branches to refer the different design patterns:
1. lexicon_MVC (MVC design pattern)
2. lexicon_MVP (MVP design pattern)     [IN-PROGRESS]
3. lexicon_MVVP (MVVM design pattern)   [TBD]
